---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install git locally
$git --version
$git --help
$git config --global user.name "Sowmya"
$git config --global user.email sowmyagulla@gmail.com
$git config --list  - to check the configuration
create ur folder
$mkdir Git_Demo
$cd Git_Demo - navigates to this folder (base folder to create all repositories/folder)
$mkdir FirstRepo - created a folder(repository)
$cd FirstRepo  - it is empty folder 
To create a repository
$git init - then adds .git folder is added to FirstRepo folder
create some files
$touch master.txt
$notepad master.txt - write any code
$git status - untracked files are shown - all the status of the files is given like any file is added or modified or deleted.
$git add . - adds all files to stage or its added to gits index or its ready for staging
$git commit -m "message!!" - file is committed
$git log - all commits history showing the latest on top
To push local files to server so that others can also work on that 
Go to GitHub 
create a repo with same name as local i.e (FirstRepo)
take the http url and add in local
$git remote add origin https://github.com/sowmyagulla/FirstRepo.git - to add/push local files to server repo for the frst time
$git remote -v - to check whether its added correctly to server
$git push -u origin master - to push from local to server - -u is for upstream linking - the files are pushed to server from local
--------------------------------------------
here we used http, to use ssh key
$ssh-keygen -t rsa -C sowmyagulla - a public key and private key is generated
give any pwd
add in the github settings ssh keys
$ssh -T git@github.com
------------------------------------------------
to clone a repo to local from server, create a repo in server
$git clone Server_repo_url     - http or ssh url - to clone any repo from server to local
$git log --pretty=oneline - shows the log history in onlines
$git reset --soft commit id(paste the log id which u want to reset)  - no msg shows -  removes the top logs until log id given
$git reset --soft HEAD~ to revert the last commit
$git reset --soft HEAD~2 to revert the 2 last commits
$git log --pretty=online - shows the log list from this log id and removes the top logs
$git checkout filename - to revert to previous changes
$git checkout -- .  - To revert all files which are modified
Do the above changes only when not pushed to server
$git revert commit/log id - it undoes all the changes done as part of this cmd
$git log --pretty=oneline
-------------------------------------------
Branching  -- non-linear becoz it stores as a tree
$git branch branchname
$git branch -v - shows list of branch 
$git checkout branchname  - to move to that branch from master branch
add any files in the branch , so that it only shows in the branch and not in the master branch
$git push -u origin branchname -to push any particular branch to server 
$git checkout -b branchname -- branch and checkout together 
$git checkout master
$git merge branchname  -merges changes to master branch  - before merging to master checkout to master branch so that new branch merges to master
$git branch -d branchname  - while removing u shouldn't be on that particular branch
to make this changes in server
$git push origin --delete branchname - deletes the branch in server also

----------------------
Rebasing - used to make a linear sequence of commits 
$git checkout branchname
$git rebase master - add commits to the tip of master to have linear flow


JAVA 
Inheritance - one class acquring the properties of other class using extend keyword
subclass ,derived, child class extends base ,super, parent class
to access the properties/fileds of parent class from child class in constructor - use super() to invoke parent class fileds to child class and it should be the frst statment in the child constructor

Encapuslation - binding data & methods together 
hiding all the properties from outside the world. only class can access all the properties - u have complete control of the class 
1.the properties are initiated using private which makes its restricted to outside that class
2. using getter method to access those properties with right visibility. - public - u define how to outside world to access ur properties
3. if u want to rewrite/overridden or set/add new value to any property use setter method - public - u define how u want to replace the values

Abstraction - only show relevant data and hide internal details of a particular object from the outside world
abstract is a keyword which can be used infront of a class or method
abstract class cannot be instantiated(u cannot call the constructor of the class) ,but they can be subclassed(u can extend that abstract class).
abstract class can have concrete and abstract methods
abstract methods are only declared without definition or implementation - the extended class must provide implementation for these abstract methods
if the extended class is not providing implementation of all the abstract methods in parent class then throws error - make that child class as abstract or provide all the implementation for parent abstract methods
parent reference = new child(); 

polymorphism - an entity can take multiple forms - an entity can be an obj, class or a method
here we are taking a method which takes many forms
--method overloading - the name of method remains same but the type of the return  may change and no.of args or type of args may change
--method overriding - used together with inheritance - if the superclass defines a method and then subclass again tries to define the method with exact same signature and provided its own implementation.

Exception handling

for handling the exceptions we use try-catch blocks in java
try{code}
catch and finally blocks

finally is used for clean up operations and executes even if the exception occurs or not - ex. to close file handler resource, if you open data base connection

throw
throws


Hashset class in java - is part of the set interface hierarcy and sets have a property that they give the collection elements unique.
hashset elements will be accesed in random fashion not in a sequence(not ordered)

HashSet<String> h=new HashSet<String>();// hashset is a concrete class 
or  
Set<String> h=new HashSet<>();
h.add("a");
h.add("a");
SOP(h);  //o/p [a] prints single a and removes duplicates, output is in random fashion sometimes abc or bca or cba
h.contains("c"); return boolean
h.remove("a");

TreeSet - maintains natural ordering of elements. cannot have duplicate elements. not sychronized so not thread safe
Set<String> h=new TreeSet<>();
h.add("b");
h.add("a");
h.add("c");
h.add("c");
SOP(h);  //o/p [a,b,c] maintains natural order of alphabets. applies sorting here

Map - to store key value arrangement elements
keys are unique and the values can have duplicates
map is reusing classes from collection framework. Map uses set class to store its keys and for values it uses list class
Hashtable - thread safe - allow 1 thread to access the hash table at a particular time. slower
HashMap and TreeMap - not thread safe - faster
LinkedHashMap - the elements are stored in random order(hash property) and maintains sequence{linkedlist}(elements are accessed as inserted)
TreeMap -maintains natural ordering of element on keys.


HashMap - 
HashMap<String, Integer> h=new HashMap<>();
h.put("a",1);
h.put("b",2);
SOP(h); // o/p {a=1,b=2}

for(String key : h.keySet())
SOP(key "," h.get(key)); //o/p a,1     b,2

for(Entry<String,Integer> entry : h.entrySet())
SOP(entry.getKey() "," entry.getValue()); //o/p a,1     b,2

TreeMap -
TreeMap<Integer,String> map=new TreeMap<>();
map.put(3,"a");
map.put(2,"b");
SOP(map); //o/p {2=b, 3=a}


Maven - is a popular open source build tool developed by Apache Group to build,publish, and deploy several projects at once.
maven is written in java
build tool to build and manage java-based projects. manages dependencies
Maven is based on POM (Project Object Model) and focuses of simplification and standardization of the building process.
maven also helps us in getting right JAR files for each project
mvnrepository.com - to download repositories.

Maven repository refer to the directories of package JAR files that contain meta data. the meta data refers to the POM files relevant to the project
This metadata is what allows maven to download dependencies
3 types of repos:
Local repos - ur pc
remote repos -  any server
central repos - internet

Basic concepts of Maven:
1. POM - refers to the XML files that have all the information regarding project and configuration details.
It has the description of the project, details regarding the versioning and configuration management of the project
the XML file is in the project home directory. maven searches for POM in the current directory when any task is to be executed
2. Dependencies and Repositories - Dependencies refer to the java libraries that r needed for the project.
Repositories refer to the directories of packaged  JAR files
3.Build Lifecycles, phases and goals- build lifecycles consist of sequence of build phases , and each build phase consist of sequence od goals
each goal is responsible for particular task
4.Build profiles - refer to the set of configuration values, that are required to build a project using different configurations
5.Build Plugins - refer to group of goals.These goals may or may not be of same phase

Maven Architecture 
Maven -> pom file (basics concepts) -> maven repository

How it works:
read pom.xml file
download dependencies defined in pom.xml into local repo from central repo.
create and generate a report according to the requirements, and execute life-cycles ,phases,goals and plugins etc.

Maven Build Life cycle - is a collection of steps that are to be followed to build a project
3 steps:
Default: handles project deployement
Clean: handles project cleaning
Site: handles the creation of project site's documentation


Jenkins - Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server that can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. 
Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
