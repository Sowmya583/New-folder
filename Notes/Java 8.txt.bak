Lambda expressions - provides implementation to functional interface.
It provides a clear and concise way to represent method of FI using an expression.
FI - An interface which contains only one abstract method - before lambdas used anonymous classes
FI can have any no.of default and static methods but only one abstract method
FI also called as single abstract method interfaces. helps to achieve functional programming.
(Arguments list)-> { Body }

EX 1:

WITHOUT LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

@FunctionalInterface //optional to write
interface Sayable{  
    public String say();  
}
public class LambdaExpressionExample1 implements Sayable{  
	public static void main(String[] args) { 
	
	Sayable s = new Sayable();
	@Override 
	public String say(){
		return "I Have nothing to say";
	}
      
    System.out.println(s.say());  
	}  
} 

WITH LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

@FunctionalInterface //optional to write
interface Sayable{  
    public String say();  
}  
public class LambdaExpressionExample1{  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
    Sayable s=()->{  
        return "I have nothing to say.";
    };  
    System.out.println(s.say());  
	}  
} 

EX 2: 
List<String> fruits = new ArrayList<String>();
fruits.add("apple");
fruits.add("banana");
fruits.add("orange");

fruits.forEach(               // forEach internally uses consumer FI.
(n)-> System.out.println(n);  // using lambda to iterate through collection
);

=>In-built FI in java 8
1. Consumer FI - we use this when we need a obj as input  and performs some operations on that object but doesn't return anything.
void accept(T t); - generic type obj
EX: lambda exp of abstract method of consumer FI.

public class ConsumerDemo{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Consumer<Integer> consumer = (t) -> {
		System.out.println("Printing : " + t);
	};
	consumer.accept(10); - calls accept method from Consumer interface and takes interger as input.
	}	
}
->forEach uses consumer as an argument.
Ex: List<Integer> list= Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
	list.stream().forEach(t -> SOP(prints all numbs:" +t));

2. Predicate FI - used for conditional checks.(true or false).
boolean test(T t);
EX: Even or Odd
public class PredicateDemo{
	public static void main(String[] args){
	Predicate<Integer> predicate = (t) -> {
		if(t%2==0)
		{
			return true;
		}
		else
			return false;
	};
	System.out.println(predicate.test(10)); - calls test method from Predicate interface and takes interger as input and return boolean.
	}	
}
->filter method uses predicate as an argument.
Ex: List<Integer> list= Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5);
	list.stream().filter(t -> t%2==0).forEach(t -> SOP("prints Even numb:" +t));


3. Supplier FI - can be used in all contexts where there is no input but an output is expected.
T get();
EX: 
Supplier<String> supplier = ()-> { return "Returns always string"; };
SOP(supplier.get()); // o/p - Returns always string

-> when filter result doesn't exits then sends dummy data
List<String> list= Arrays.asList("a", "b");
SOP(list.stream().findAny().orElseGet(supplier)); // o/p - a

List<String> list= Arrays.asList();
SOP(list.stream().findAny().orElseGet(()-> "No elements";));  //o/p - No elements
 

Streams:

-> It simply conveys elements from a source such as a data structure, an array, or an I/O channel, through a pipeline of computational operations.
-> Stream does not store elements.
-> Stream API is used to process collection of objects. with functional style of coding using lambda expressions. 
-> A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired o/p.
-> You can use stream to filter, collect, print, and convert from one data structure to other etc
Methods: Filter - for conditional check, forEach - for iteration.

Ex:

class Product{
	int id;
	String name;
	constructor..
}
main(){
	List<Product> l=new ArrayList<Product>();
	l.add(new Product(1,"a",2500);
	l.add(new Product(1,"b",3000);
	
	List<float> l2 = l.stream()
	.filter(p->p.price>2000)// filtering data
	.map(p->p.price)// fetching data  - transforming data from Product to float.
	.collect(Collectors.toList());//collecting as list
	sot(l2);//output is price list about 2000 products

}

-> Sorting a list
EX:
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(8);
list.add(12);
list.add(4);

SOP(Collections.sort(list)); - sorts list in asc order - 4,8,12
Collections.reverse(list); desc order - 12,8,4

sort using lambda:
list.stream().sorted().forEach(s->SOP(s)); - asc order
list.stream().sorted(Comparator.reverseOrder()).forEach(s->SOP(s)); - desc order 

-for sorting of objs like employee, student based on fields we use comparators
List<Employee> employees = new List<>();
Collections.sort(employees, new MyComparator());
SOP(employees);

class MyComparator implements Comparator<Employee>{
	@Override
	public int compare(Employee o1, Employee o2){
		return o1.getSalary()-o2.getSalary(); //ASC order
		return o2.getSalary()-o1.getSalary(); //DESC order
	}
}

-Comparator is a FI so use lambda exp
Collections.sort(employees,(o1,o2)->(o1.getSalary()-o2.getSalary()) );

- using stream API
employees.stream().sorted((o1,o2)->(o1.getSalary()-o2.getSalary())).forEach(System.out::println);
employees.stream().sorted(Comparator.comparing(emp->emp.getSalary())).forEach(System.out::println);

=> Stream API intermediate methods - returns another stream as part of o/p.
Map() & flatMap()
1. map() - used for data transformation - 1-1 mapping - produce 1 val for 1 i/p
	It processes stream of values.
	It does only mapping
	It's mapper function produces single value for each i/p value
	It is 1-1 mapping
	data transformation: from stream to stream
	Use this method when mapper function is producing a single value for each i/p value.

- Data transformation 
transform data from lowercase to upper case.
Stream.of("a","b","c"); - [A,B,C]
EX: List<Employee> convert to List<String> -> Data Transforming - takes employee data and gets salary of employees as float in a list.
one - one mapping -> one employee has one email id
List<String> emails = employees.stream().map(emp->emp.getEmail()).collect(Collectors.toList());
SOP(emails);

2. flatMap() - used for data transformation & flattering - map() + flattering - 1- many mapping - produce multiple values for each i/p.
	It processes stream of stream of values.
	It performs mapping and flattering
	It's mapper function produces multiple values for each i/p value
	It is 1-many mapping
	data transformation: from stream of stream to stream
	Use this method when mapper function is producing a multiple values for each i/p value.

- Flattering
converting stream of stream data to single stream is flattering
[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]] -  [1,2,3,4,5,6]
EX: one employee has many phone numbers then use flattering  - 1- many mapping
List<String> phones = employees.stream().flatmap(emp->emp.getPhoneNumbers().stream()).collect(Collectors.toList());
SOP(phones); 

=>Map-Reduce 

Map-Reduce is a functional programming model it serves our 2 purpose
Map - Transforming data
Reduce - Aggregating data - combine elements of a stream and produces a single value
Ex: Stream:[2,4,6,1,3] sum of numbs in stream?
map() - transform stream<obj> to stream of int
reduce() - combines stream of int and produce the sum as result
reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator);
identity is initial value , accumulator is function for performing aggregation
List<Integer> num = Arrays.asList(3,4,6,1,9);
Interger reducesum = num.stream().reduce(0,(a,b)->a+b);
SOP(reducesum): // o/p - sum of elements

->FI's before JAVA 8
Runnable - run method
Callable - call method
Comparator - compare method

-> FI's after JAVA 8
Consumer - accept method
Predicate - test method
Supplier - get method
Function - apply method

interface Function<T, R>{
	R apply(T t);
}

lambda - Function<Interger, String> func = (t)->{"output: " +t};
		 SOP(func.apply(10)); // o/p output: 10 - takes integer as i/p and gives o/p as string.



->Comparator - is FI 
Contains two abstract methods still called as FI.
@FunctionalInterface
interface Comparator{

	int compare(T o1, T o2); // abstract method 
	boolean equals(Object obj); // equals is a abstract method overriding from the Javalang.Object So doesn't count as an abstract method
	                            // equals is inherited from obj class not from comparator
	
}

->Use of default and static methods in FI.
It there is only abstract method then it will force all the implementations to override this abstract method.
If you define a method as default then it won't force implementation class to override that default method. if someone want to override then can override or else the default method remains same.
The static methoad acts as a utility class and can add few of the methods which are widely used in project.
or repeatedly using code can be kept as a static method in utility class , rather than that u can keep it inside a same interface which is been used as part of implementation

-> Can we extend FI ?
yes, we can extend but it doesn't act as  FI it acts as nrml interface because multiple abstract methods need to implement which is not possible in FI(takes only one abstract method). 
EX: 
@FunctionalInterface - error- remove this for extending
interface Payment extends orders{
	void pay(); - 1 abstract method to implement

}
interface Orders{
	void cart(); - 2 abstract method to implement
}

-> Method reference - used to refer a method of FI
shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method

System.out.println(t); - nrml way 
System.out::println; - method reference - println is a static method 
method reference can be static method reference or instance method reference or constructor methoad reference

Test{
	Test t = new Tes();
	forEach(t::print); // o/p prints elements using instance method reference
	
	void print(int i){ // if public startWith print then (Test::print); // static method reference
	SOP(i);	

-> Stream vs parallel stream in java 8
Both are used to process grp of obj
stream exceute in a single core of ur machine with sequencial flow  - for write operations to maintain consistency
parallel stream uses multiple core of ur machine (All the threads uses multiple core of ur machine) - better performance but not always recommeneded - for read operations

->CompletableFuture
Used for asynchronous programming in java.
Asynchronus programming is a means of writing non-blocking code by running a task on a separate thread than the main 
application thread and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.
extension of Future obj which was introduced in java 5

->why completablefuture why not future?
It cannot be manually completed
Multiple functions cannot be chained together
No exception handling

->How to decide thread pool size? depends on type of task you are exceuting
CPU intensive tasks
IO intensive tasks

->GroupingBy method


->Deafult and static method in interfaces
default method is used to define a method with default implementation.
You can override default method also to provide more specific implementation for the method.
Static methods are used to define utility methods(class methods). 

interface Sayable{    
    // default method    
    default void say(){    
        System.out.println("Hello, this is default method");    
    }    
    // Abstract method    
    void sayMore(String msg); 
	
    // static method    
    static void sayLouder(String msg){    
        System.out.println(msg);    
    }    
}    
public class DefaultMethods implements Sayable{    
    public void sayMore(String msg){     // implementing abstract method    
        System.out.println(msg);    
    }    
    public static void main(String[] args) {    
        DefaultMethods dm = new DefaultMethods();    
        dm.say();                       // calling default method    
        dm.sayMore("Work is worship");      // calling abstract method    
        Sayable.sayLouder("Helloooo...");   // calling static method  using class itself
    }    
}    

-> forEach() loop - new method forEach() to iterate the elements

public class ForEachExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        List<String> gamesList = new ArrayList<String>();  
        gamesList.add("Football");  
        gamesList.add("Cricket");  
        gamesList.forEach(games -> System.out.println(games));  
          
    }  
} 




























List<integer> numb=Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4);// giving array elements

Brute Force Method: is an approach that finds all the possible solutions to find a satisfactory solution to a given problem. O(n)=size of input


trim() - removes leading and tailing spaces in the string
String str = " follow me to moon  ";
String s2 = str.trim(); // "follow me to moon"


split() - breaks the string at the separator. returns an array of substrings.

String str = " follow me to moon  ";
String[] arr = s.split(" "); 
for(String ele: arr)
sop(ele); // follow , me , to , moon

String to character array conversion:

String str = "sowmya";

char[] arr = str.toCharArray(); // s,o,w....
